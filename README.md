# ðŸ“Š Financial Scenario Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an **interactive financial scenario analysis dashboard**, developed using **Streamlit**. The tool was designed as part of an academic capstone project to examine long-term financial growth, evaluate risk, and explore the impact of various investment assumptions.

The dashboard follows a **structured workflow**:
1. Hypotheses and expected outcomes
2. Data sources and assumptions
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data processing and feature engineering
5. Modelling and scenario analysis
6. Results and interpretation
7. Deployment and reproducibility
